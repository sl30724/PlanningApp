# PlanningApp
This app is made for Mobile App Dev 2022 Fall class

# Main idea

A daily-planner app that promotes self-care and encourages rest time.

Have you ever felt stressed just thinking about all the tasks you've planned for yourself today?
Most planner apps focus on producticity. And most self-care apps encourage rest time. What if there's an app that does both?
By giving humurous compliments on completing every task, encouraging self-care time minus the annoying positivity outlook bullsh$t, planning your day can be more rewarding, fun, and less stressful.

# Goal

The goal of this project is essentially creating an app that I want to use myself!
